To Do (03.12.2018) :

- Clean up the sample run file 

Post Processing files (All of us)

-Spectral to Physical: 
  - geometry dependent (but user nows provides this)
  
  - grid = make_grid(N,'type',options: full, meridional, equitorial, x-y, x-z, y-z) 
    type options: (Chebyshev, Fourier, Worland , Legendre)
      **** see how Philippe implements these ****
      Fourier = linspace
      Chebyshev = Meredith has this routine in Matlab
      Worland = Leo has this in Python (maybe)
      Legendre = not done so far
      
  - convertSpectral(grid, ...?) 
    equatorial cut
    meridional cut
    plane layer
    vertical cut
    3D
    iso-radius
